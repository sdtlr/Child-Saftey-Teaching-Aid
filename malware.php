			<p><h2><b>Malware</b></h2></p>
			<p><h3><b>What is malware?</b></h3></p>
			<img align="right" height="150" width="150" src="images/malware.png" />
			<ul>
			<li>Malware stands for Malicious Software.</li>
			<li>There are three main types of malware including Viruses, Trojans and Spyware. These are
			the most common found in regular use of computers.</li>
			<li>The job of malware is to cause damage to a computer system by infecting that computer and
			carrying out harmful attacks on this system.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><h2><b>Viruses</b></h2></p>
			<p><h3><b>What is a virus?</b></h3></p>
			<ul>
			<li>A computer virus makes many copies of itself when stored on a computer and a copy of this
			will attach itself to an email which allows for the virus to be spread.</li>
			<li>It is also possible to put a virus on a CD or USB stick which can then be inputted into a
			computer to cause harm.</li>
			<li>A single virus can produce many hundreds of copies of itself.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><h3><b>How can you prevent viruses?</b></h3></p>
			<p>It is possible to prevent viruses by installing antivirus software onto a computer system that you
			want to protect.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>It is possible to put computers into a mode called Administrator Mode which unlocks special
			permission for the user. Doing this means that any viruses on that system ALSO have access
			to these important files and folders, it is important to keep the computer running in
			standard mode.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><h2><b>Trojans</b></h2></p>
			<p><h3><b>What are Trojans?</b></h3></p>
			<ul>
			<li>A Trojan is a type of virus which is disguised as an existing application. On the desktop of a
			computer there are lots of program executable files which the user can run. If a virus is on a
			computer these programs could be harmful when activated.</li>
			<li>Trojans find back doors in computer systems. This means that another person could be
			watching what the user of a computer is doing without that person knowing.</li>
			<li>That person could turn off your computer, steal your information and even play your games
			without you letting them.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><h3><b>How can you prevent Trojans?</b></h3></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Trojans can be prevented by installing anti-malware programs. These programs scan your
			computer and find any malware which they then remove permanently from your computer
			making it safe.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><h2><b>Worm</b></h2></p>
			<p><h3><b>What is a computer worm?</b></h3></p>
			<ul>
			<li>A computer worm is a replicating program that travels through networks and emails with
			the intent of causing harm. Unlike a computer virus a worm does not attach itself to a
			program or file.</li>
			<li>This means that they don't intend to directly harm your computer. Instead they will take up
			space inside your computer with the idea of slowing your devices down.</li>
			<li>Inside a computer is a processor, this is like a brain. The Worm wastes time and space inside
			this hardware stopping it from finishing important tasks.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><h3><b>How can you prevent worms?</b></h3></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Worms can be stopped by always turning on your firewall. This stops the code from getting
			into your network as the door is shut to the important parts of your computer.</li>
			<li>Existing worms can be removed by running antivirus software which will pick up the
			malicious software.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><h2><b>Spyware</b></h2></p>
			<p><h3><b>What is spyware?</b></h3></p>
			<img align="right" height="220" width="220" src="images/spyware.jpg" />
			<ul>
			<li>Spyware is malicious software that is not always a computer virus. It is possible that a
			company can install adware which targets your personal information and sends this without
			your knowing to a company for analysis. This means that your personal information is taken
			and used by other people.</li>
			<li>Spyware can be used to collect information on banking, money and personal information. It
			can even change your computer settings. Spyware doesn't necessarily cause malicious
			outcomes and the sole purpose isn't to break your computer.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><h3><b>How can you prevent spyware?</b></h3></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Spyware can be prevented by reading terms and condition when installing new software to
			ensure that no additional programs are being obtained over what you want to install.</li>
