			<p><h2><b>Phishing</b></h2></p>
			<p><h3><b>What is Phishing?</b></h3></p>
			<img align="right" height="174" width="240" src="images/phishing.jpg" />
			<p>Phishing is when someone sends an email to people so that they can trick the people into giving
			them their details and information.</p>
			<p>Phishing emails will often look just like real websites, but will be fake and used for stealing
			information from people.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Phishing can be against the law.</li>
			<li>Phishing is normally done by email.</li>
			<li>Phishing emails often end up in the junk email box.</li>
			<li>Phishing emails normally offer something that people might want, like money, or prizes. Then to
			get the money or prizes they ask you to give them your details and information.</li>
			<li>You might get an email that says it's from your bank or from another real site. They usually
			include a link to a fake website that looks just like the real one. When you log in it sends your
			username and password to someone who will use it to access your real accounts. They might
			steal your money or your identity.</li>
			<li>Your bank will never send you an email asking for your personal information or your username
			and password.</li>
			<li>Phishing emails look like they are from real, trust websites, and people, and normally have real
			logos and names, but these can copied and can't be trusted.</li>
			<li>Phishing websites use web addresses that look like real, trusted websites, but this doesn't mean
			they are safe.</li>
			<li>Web addresses with jumbled letters and numbers as the site name are often phishing websites.</li>
			<li>Public email addresses like outlook, Gmail, or yahoo aren't used by real websites normally, so if
			the email you get has a public email address it might be a phishing email.</li>
			<li>Phishing emails often have bad spelling and grammar, real websites do not normally have these
			errors.</li>
			<li>Rushing a response - phishers like to try to push you into doing things fast without thinking.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><h3><b>How to prevent phishing?</b></h3></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Always use a trusted email service such as; outlook, gmail, or yahoo mail when using you email –
			These have spam filter which put spam into a junk email box for you.</li>
			<li>Do not give anyone you don't know your email address. When signing up to websites, if you
			don't have to give your email address then don't give it.</li>
			<li>Keep an eye out for tick boxes – when you sign up to a website, it might try to sign you up to
			other things. Read the small print next to the tick boxes carefully.</li>
			<li>If you get an email asking for you to update information, go straight to the organization's
			Website instead to find out whether the email was real or fake. Never email your information,
			because a scammer could steal your identity, privacy, or money.</li>
			<li>If you don't know the sender, be careful about opening emails, clicking on links within them and
			replying to them.</li>
			<li>Web addresses with jumbled letters and numbers as the site name should not be trusted.</li>
			<li>Don't be rushed into doing things fast without thinking because of emails.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><h2><b>Shoulder Surfing</b></h2></p>
			<p><h3><b>What is shoulder surfing?</b></h3></p>
			<img align="right" height="169" width="240" src="images/shouldersurfing.jpg" />
			<p>Shoulder surfing is when someone looks at what someone else is doing, so that they can steal their
			information.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Shoulder surfing is easy for people because they can hang around in crowded places and watch
			people without them knowing quite easily.</li>
			<li>Shoulder surfing is also done from quite far away sometimes using binoculars or devices that can
			see and record information.</li>
			<li>Sometimes shoulder surfing is done by hiding recording devices in places that people use their
			devices and recording what they do on them.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><h3><b>How to prevent shoulder surfing?</b></h3></p>
			<ul>
			<li><p>When using computers or any other device make sure no one else can see the information you
			are entering or looking at:</p>
			<p>- Make sure your back is to a wall so that no one can see what you're doing.</p>
			<p>- Enter and look at important information in a place that no one else can see, not a public
			place.</p>
			<p>- Delete mail from your junk folder regularly.</p>
			</ul>
			<p><h2><b>Baiting</b></h2></p>
			<p><h3><b>What is baiting?</b></h3></p>
			<p>Baiting is when someone puts something nasty (harmful software) inside a download file or on a
			device that you might like to download or use. They then wait for someone to download the file, or
			they leave the device out for someone to find, then the harmful software will infect any computers it
			is used on.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Baiting is usually done using something you would like to have or use, such as a movie or
			music download or a USB memory device.</li>
			<li>If a computer gets infected it can then be controlled by the harmful software and anything
			on the system can be destroyed, changed, or stolen.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><h3><b>How to prevent baiting?</b></h3></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Never download a file if you don't know if it's safe.</li>
			<li>Never plug a device you find into a computer unless you're sure the device is safe.</li>
			<li>Download a virus and internet security protection from an official website, such as AVG,
			Avast, or Norton, or buy them from a trusted shop and install them.</li>
